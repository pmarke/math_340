: Prove Theorem 3.2.8.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
We want to prove that a set 
\begin_inset Formula $F\subseteq\R$
\end_inset

 is closed if and only if every Cauchy sequence contained in 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 has a limit that is also an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

.
 This is a biconditional statement so we must prove both ways.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\implies\right):$
\end_inset

 We assume directly that 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is closed, then it contains all of it's limit points.
 According to theorem 3.2.5, every possible sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

 contained in 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 must have a limit in 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

.
 Since every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence, every Cauchy sequence
 contained in 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 has it's limit in 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\impliedby\right):$
\end_inset

 We assume directly that every Cauchy sequence contained in 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 has a limit that is also an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

.
 According to theorem 3.2.5, a point is a limit point if and only if it is
 the limit of some sequence contained in 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

.
 Thus every limit point is contained in 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

; therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is closed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Since we have proven both implications, the biconditional statement is true.

An open set that contains every rational number must necessarily be all

\begin_inset Argument 1
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Disproof
\end_layout

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 be the open set that contains every rational number defined by 
\begin_inset Formula $\R-\left\{ \sqrt{2}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Given any element 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in A$
\end_inset

, there exists a neighborhood 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\epsilon}\left(a\right)$
\end_inset

 contained in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 due to the density of the set.
 For example, let 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=\frac{\abs{a-\sqrt{2}}}{2}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\epsilon}\left(a\right)\subseteq A$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in A$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, this counterexample contradicts the original statement.

The Nested Interval Property remains true if the term

closed set
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Argument 1
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Disproof
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The empty set is a closed set.
 Any intersection of sets including the empty set results in the empty set,
 which is empty.
 Thus, this property doesn't remain true for any nested closed sets.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Every nonempty open set contains a rational number.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Proof
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 be an arbitrary nonempty open set, there there exists an 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in A$
\end_inset

 and an open neighborhood 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\epsilon}\left(a\right)$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\epsilon}\left(a\right)\subseteq A$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the open interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a-\epsilon,a+\epsilon\right)$
\end_inset

 is a subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Since there is a rational number between any two real numbers, there must
 be a rational number 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 that is an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a-\epsilon,a+\epsilon\right)$
\end_inset

, and thus an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the statement is true.

Disproof
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We will disprove the statement with a counter example.
 Consider the set 
\begin_inset Formula $A=\left\{ \sqrt{2}+\frac{\sqrt{2}}{n}\,:\,n\in\N\right\} \cup\left\{ \sqrt{2}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The set 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 doesn't contain any rational number, it is bounded between 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

, it is infinite since the natural numbers is an infinite set, and it is
 closed since the limit point 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

 is contained in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The Cantor set is closed.

The Cantor set is constructed from the infinite intersection of closed sets.
 According to Theorem 3.2.14, the Cantor set must be closed.

: Given 
\begin_inset Formula $A\subseteq\R$
\end_inset

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Show that the set 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is closed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Proof
We assume directly that 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is the set of all limit points of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 be a limit point of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

, then given an 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{1}-$
\end_inset

neighborhood 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\epsilon_{1}}\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

, there exists an 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell\in V_{\epsilon_{1}}\left(x\right)\cap L$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell\neq x$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\ell$
\end_inset

 is a limit point of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, then given an 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{2}-$
\end_inset

neighborhood, there exists an 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in V_{\epsilon_{2}}\left(\ell\right)\cap A$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $a\neq\ell$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=\epsilon_{1}+\epsilon_{2}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in V_{\epsilon}\left(x\right)\cap A$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $a\neq x$
\end_inset

.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is also a limit point of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and must be in 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, all of the limit points of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 are contained in 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

, which means that 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is closed.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Argue that if 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is a limit point of

\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is a limit point of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Use this observation to furnish a proof for Theorem 3.2.12.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Proof
We assume directly that 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is the set containing all of the limit point of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, and is therefore closed according to part a).
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is closed, it contains all of it's limit points which must also be a limit
 point of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Thus if 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is a limit point of 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{A}=A\cup L$
\end_inset

, it must be a limit point of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 This means that all of the limit points of 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{A}$
\end_inset

 are contained in 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{A}$
\end_inset

.
 Now to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{A}$
\end_inset

 is the smallest closed set containing 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, suppose, by contradiction, that 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{B}$
\end_inset

 is a smaller closed set that contains 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{B}\subsetneq\overline{A}$
\end_inset

, then there is an element 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in L$
\end_inset

 that is not in 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{B}$
\end_inset

, thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{B}$
\end_inset

 doesn't contain all of the limit points of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and cannot be closed.
 This is a contradiction, thus there exists no smaller closed set that contains
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

\begin_inset Formula $\overline{A}^{c}\cap\overline{A^{c}}=\overline{A}^{c}$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{A}^{c}$
\end_inset

 is open, the set is open.
 To show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{A}^{c}\subseteq\overline{A^{c}}$
\end_inset

, let 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\overline{A}^{c}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $x\notin\overline{A}$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $x\notin A\cup L$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 being the set containing all the limit points of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset
